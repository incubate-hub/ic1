Time Complexity and Space Complexity

This repository contains sample code and explanations of time complexity and space complexity in algorithms.


What is Time Complexity?

Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to solve a problem as the input size grows. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time, and it is expressed using the Big O notation.


What is Space Complexity?

Space complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to solve a problem as the input size grows. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of memory usage, and it is also expressed using the Big O notation.


Examples

This repository contains sample code that demonstrates the time complexity and space complexity of various algorithms, including:
